# TCP Proxy

Internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. 
The request then comes back through that same proxy server 
(there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server 
forwards the data received from the website to you.




## Usage/Examples

```bash
chmod +x proxy.py
./proxy.py [localhost] [localport] [remotehost] [remoteport] [receive_first]

# Example: proxy.py 127.0.0.1 9000 10.11.121.4 9000 True
```
